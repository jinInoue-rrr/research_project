  abstract = "An increasing demand for both formal and informal care is likely
              to result from the ongoing demographic transition at the same
              time as there is a further move away from the traditional
              domestic division of labour. Public policy-making that aims at
              increasing the supply of informal care necessitates knowledge
              about the relative importance of various incentives for
              individual care providers. This paper takes as a point of
              departure that the willingness to supply informal care is partly
              explained by the extent to which it adversely affects
              labour-market outcomes and analyses the effect on labour-market
              outcomes of providing informal care to one's elderly parent(s)
              among the 50+ of Europe. Data from SHARE (Survey of Health,
              Ageing, and Retirement in Europe) was used to examine the
              association between, on the one hand, hours of informal care
              provided and, on the other, (1) the probability of employment,
              (2) hours worked, and (3) wages, respectively. The results
              suggest that giving informal care to one's elderly parents is
              associated with significant costs in terms of foregone
              labour-market opportunities and that these adverse effects vary
              between countries.",

  abstract  = "In this article, we consider identification, estimation, and
               inference procedures for treatment effect parameters using
               Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with (i) multiple time periods,
               (ii) variation in treatment timing, and (iii) when the
               ``parallel trends assumption'' holds potentially only after
               conditioning on observed covariates. We show that a family of
               causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups,
               even if differences in observed characteristics create
               non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification
               results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability
               weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different
               aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment
               effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to
               summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment.
               We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed
               estimators and prove the validity of a computationally
               convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid
               simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we
               illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the
               effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001--2007.

  abstract = "Around 14\% of the UK labour force has informal care
              responsibilities and almost everyone in society will be an
              informal carer in their lifetime. A well-known fact in the small
              economic literature on informal care is the apparent negative
              relation between care responsibilities and labour market
              participation. Yet, caring and labour market participation may be
              endogenous. Using an instrumental variable approach and panel
              data techniques and employing data from the British Household
              Panel Study from 1991 to 2002, this paper shows that not

              on the employment decision of informal carers. Moreover, it is

  abstract = "Understanding the effect of informal care for an elderly or
              disabled person on labor market outcomes is important for
              developing policies targeted towards caregivers. However, because
              of omitted variables bias, simple cross-sectional relationships
              may provide a misleading picture of the causal impact of informal
              care provision on labor force status. To address this, I use
              panel data for the period 2001--2007, which make it possible to
              track the same individuals over time, and observe how their
              outcomes alter as their care arrangements change. While
              caregiving does appear to have a modest negative impact on labor
              force participation, this impact is only one-quarter to one-sixth
              as large in the panel as in the cross-section. Taking account of
              individual heterogeneity, the impact of caregiving on other labor
              force outcomes (and on life satisfaction) seems to be small or
              non-existent. Large estimated effects from cross-sectional
              regressions are most likely driven by individual heterogeneity.
              One possible interpretation of this result is that the impact of
              caregiving on labor market outcomes and life satisfaction takes
              several years to manifest itself. Another is that the causal
              effect of caregiving on labor force outcomes and life
              satisfaction is quite small.",

               informal caregivers have less attachment to the labor force. The
               causal mechanism is unclear: do children who work less become
               informal caregivers, or are children who become caregivers
               working less? Using longitudinal data from the Health and
               Retirement Study, we identify the relationship between informal
               care and work in the United States, both on the intensive and
               extensive margins, and examine wage effects. We control for
               time-invariant individual heterogeneity; rule out or control for
               endogeneity; examine effects for men and women separately; and
               analyze heterogeneous effects by task and intensity. We find
               modest decreases-2.4 percentage points-in the likelihood of
               working for male caregivers providing personal care. Female
               chore caregivers, meanwhile, are more likely to be retired. For
               female care providers who remain working, we find evidence that
               they decrease work by 3-10hours per week and face a 3 percent
               lower wage than non-caregivers. We find little effect of
